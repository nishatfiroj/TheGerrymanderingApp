                    These congressional districts are drawn by an algorithm to
                    be compact. This map minimizes the average distance between
                    each citizen and their district's geographic center. The
                    algorithm doesn’t care about party or race (meaning this map
                    could violate the Voting Rights Act) and ignores city and
                    county boundaries.{" "}

                    This map simulates the approach that a nonpartisan
                    commission might take if tasked with drawing districts with
                    compact shapes — without regard to party or race (meaning
                    that this map could violate the Voting Rights Act). It seeks
                    to use counties as district building blocks and splits them
                    only as many times as necessary to create equally populous
                    districts. Where possible, entire districts are nested
                    within counties.

                    those districts require. The map also preserves existing
                    majority-minority districts. Where highly competitive
                    districts aren’t possible, the map tries to make them as

                    This map is drawn to maximize the number of

                    single minority group make up a majority of the voting-age
                    population. Where additional majority-minority districts are
                    not possible, the map settles for “coalition” districts, in
                    which no racial group, including non-Hispanic white voters,
                    makes up a majority of the population. If it’s not possible
                    to create any districts where white voters are a minority,
                    the map tries to make districts with the highest possible
                    shares of nonwhite voters.

                    This map is drawn with the goal of making the partisan
                    breakdown of a state’s representatives match the political
                    makeup of the state’s voters. For example, if a state has 10
                    districts and Republicans won an average of 70 percent of
                    its major-party votes in the last two presidential
                    elections, seven districts are drawn to favor Republicans
                    and three are drawn to favor Democrats. There are a few
                    states in which a proportionally partisan map can’t be drawn
                    — in those states, we made the map as close to proportional
                    as possible.
